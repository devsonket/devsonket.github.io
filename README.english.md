## Motive

Cheatsheets are very handy tool for developers. Because it is not possible for us to remember all the commands or functions of a library at once. In that case, if we make a list of such commands or function does such a thing, then very easily when someone wants to work later, they can find everything they need just by looking at that list. We can divide our entire knowledge into different categories and list only the actual functionality very briefly. In which later a developer will find what he wants with just a quick glance. Similar cheatsheets are available [here](https://devhints.io/). But our aim is to make cheat sheet in full Bengali. in future if you need we try to make the cheatsheet in english also.

## How do it Works?

This project is completely GitHub based. This is where all our cheatsheets are organized as **json** files inside a directory called [**data**](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/tree/develop/data). Our main application will display the data from here. We currently support two formats of cheatsheets.

- Format with code and description([See demo here](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/blob/develop/data/demo/codendesc.json))
- Code Only([See demo here](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/blob/develop/data/demo/onlycode.json))
- mix ([see demo here](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/blob/develop/data/demo/mix.json))

Any new formats will be added in future if needed. If you want [from](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/issues/new?title=%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0%20%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A7%87%20%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F&body=%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4%20%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A8&labels=%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A8%20%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F) can create an issue to create a new format_

**(How to Contribute)**

Since we are dealing with **json** files here, many may not be familiar with **json**. For that purpose we also put a [**draft**](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/tree/develop/data/draft) directory inside the **data** directory. If you can't contribute with a **json** file, you can push your cheatsheet in any format to the draft folder with a clean title. At the same time, if you want, you can take a draft from the draft folder and convert it to **json** format and push it inside the original **data** directory. So this is how you can contribute to this project in **4 ways** if you want:

- You can push cheatsheets on any topic in Bengali **json** format by maintaining our format in any way.
- You can push cheat sheet draft on any topic in Bengali in any format.
- Can convert other's drafts to our desired **json** format and push.

There will be a few main contributors who will do the work of showing a cheatsheet on the original website. In that case those who will contribute more in our list of contributors or if anyone seems responsible enough then he will be added to the list of admins of the whole organization.

## Want an idea? 

If you don't know what topic to cheatsheet on, you can get ideas from our [project board](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/projects/1?fullscreen=true). [Here](https://github.com/devsonket/devsonket.github.io/projects/1?fullscreen=true) Basically we keep updated list of important cheatsheets that will be useful for everyone.

## Why you should contribute?

Yes, our aim here is to build a big cheat sheet repository in Bengal. [It](https://github.com/devsonket) is a completely independent and open source GitHub organization. It is not privately owned. I will reach our goal together with all of you.
